# LinearRegression-RealEstateModel
# Simulate the Ames Iowa Real Estate Market for Kaggle Competition using Linear Regression and Machine Learning.

# This project demonstrates several types of linear regression used to attempt to determine real estate prices in Ames Iowa
# using machine learning. 

# After the data is properly scaled, Ridge, Lasso and ElaticNet regression are used to predict prices in a Kaggle Machine Learning contest

# This project was something I encountered in Practical Machine Learning 422
